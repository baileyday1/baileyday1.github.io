Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>

On the other hand, they can be less stable when turning with loads and have a limited capacity range. Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling. This class of forklift is one of the most common, and what ones tend to picture when thinking of a forklift's appearance.</p>

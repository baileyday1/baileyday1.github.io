<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>The greater suspension travel allows the vehicle to navigate rough, undulating surfaces with less of a chance of the body striking the ground or any object you're trying to drive over. A couple of other comments about Komatsu are important for all forklifts. Forklifts have been lifting America's economy for over a century and we can now quantify our industry's economic contributions to the overall U.S. economy,‚Äù said Brett Wood , president and CEO of Toyota Material Handling North America and chairman of ITA.</p>

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>

Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure.

<p>These manual pallet jacks each feature a narrow fork design with entry glides and exit rollers to help allow easier access to smaller pallets with decks up to 24"W.

<h3>Types Of Material Handling Equipment Rocky Mount NC 27804</h3>
<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking. Low noise and vibration, excellent all-round visibility and easy servicing allow for improved driver comfort and forklift truck durability.</p>
<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>

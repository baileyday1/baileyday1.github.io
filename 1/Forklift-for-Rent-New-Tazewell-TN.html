<h2>Pallet Truck New Tazewell</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages.</p>

The added bonus with this machine is that it has a turning circle of just 2.5 m, compared to a standard forklift with fork extensions at 3.7 m,” says Murray. Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>

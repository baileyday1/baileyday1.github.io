Plus, their 8,000+ rental yards means there's probably one near you already. Since Rocky Ridge trucks can be hard to find at times, most drivers have numerous questions about these vehicles, from what the lift kits do to how much experience the company has.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

<h3>Mini Forklift Truck Newmarket NH</h3>

We currently have over 100 Forklifts in our rental fleet as well as Skid-Steer Loaders and a Telehandler. Adding to this, growth in sectors such as retail, FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) and pharmaceutical industries will boost the Pallet Trucks demand, especially in developing parts of the globe.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>

FMI conducts exploratory research at granular market level to arrive at concrete Pallet Trucks market segmentation.

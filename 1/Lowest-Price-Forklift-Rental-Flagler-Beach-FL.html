Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>

Not work on a forklift platform unless the industrial lift truck is on a firm flat surface and the platform is equipped with guardrails or a travel restraint system or fall-arresting system. For electric lift trucks and batteries, you'll want to review the battery charger requirements.</p>

Growth of the Pallet Trucks market is predominantly driven by the development of large-scale industrial projects in developing economies of South East Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, India and China.</p>

They can handle anything from small single pallet loads to 40-foot loaded containers. Pettibone: Based in the United States, Pettibone rough terrain equipment is the result of customer input, largely designed and developed based on marketing research collected from owners and operators.</p>

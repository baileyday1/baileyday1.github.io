Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>About 41% of these are forklifts, 1% are truck body parts, and 1% are digital signage and displays. Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site. Case Construction - one of the largest manufacturers of rough terrain lifts, Case all-terrain lifts are noteworthy for their max lift capacity and excellent handling.</p>

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>
<p>Handle only loads within the rated capacity of the truck. Rated capacity of the truck must be visible by the operator. Better visibility With a lifted truck you are situated higher giving you better visibility.

Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks. Still, with the right business plan, it can be achieved with a good level of success - forklifts are always in demand in various industries.

Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>The walk-behind pallet stacker is basically a forklift with a mast, operating on battery power. Many forklifts have an automatic alarm that will sound when you travel in reverse. Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands.

Even if you are just going to operate a forklift one time for a specific job, OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer. If your company utilizes a very narrow aisle operation this classification of lift trucks is for you.</p>
<p>Forklifts weigh thousands of lbs. For true off-road operations requiring superior traction, there are also four-wheel drive rough-terrain forklifts. From a higher center of gravity to reduced visibility in close quarters, a lifted truck or SUV certainly comes with additional roadway safety challenges. While a dealership may not seem like the obvious choice to install your vehicle's lift kit, Currie's years of rigorous training, certification and experience in lift kit installation has made them the go-to experts in suspension enhancement.</p>

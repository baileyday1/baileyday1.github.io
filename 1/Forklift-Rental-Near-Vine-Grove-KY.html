<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.

<h3>Used Yale Forklift Vine Grove KY</h3>
<p>When you're buying a new forklift or pallet loader, you can discuss trading in your old material handling equipment with the sales professionals from Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc. Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>Forklifts weigh thousands of lbs. For true off-road operations requiring superior traction, there are also four-wheel drive rough-terrain forklifts. From a higher center of gravity to reduced visibility in close quarters, a lifted truck or SUV certainly comes with additional roadway safety challenges. While a dealership may not seem like the obvious choice to install your vehicle's lift kit, Currie's years of rigorous training, certification and experience in lift kit installation has made them the go-to experts in suspension enhancement.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres.

A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>

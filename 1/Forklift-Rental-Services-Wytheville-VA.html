View our entire inventory of New or Used Rough Terrain Forklift Equipment.

<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls.

<p>Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship.

But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you outâ€”and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>

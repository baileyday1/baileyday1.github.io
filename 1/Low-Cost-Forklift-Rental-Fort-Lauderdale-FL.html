Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific.

The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity.

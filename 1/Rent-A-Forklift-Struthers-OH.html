<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV. Often called a tugger,‚Äù these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>

<h2>Pallet Truck Lifting Equipment Struthers</h2>
<p>This workshop is designed for participants who have little or no working knowledge of operating a counterbalance forklift. Do not steer pallet jacks onto uneven surfaces and avoid steep inclines. Also known as a large capacity forklift, the industrial forklift is essential for a warehouse with heavier loads. Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile and can be used in many areas of a production operation from the loading dock to the storage facility.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're in need of new , used , or rental equipment, our team will work with you to ensure you find exactly what you need to complete the job. Weight capacity may range from 3,000 to 55,000 lbs., meaning there are Class V forklifts well-suited to handling everything from single pallets to loaded 40-foot containers. You can learn to operate the Construction Lift (Class 7 ), or add Warehouse Lift (Class 1,4,5) , Reach Lift (Class 2), Order Picker (Class 2) or Walkie-Rider (Class 3) lifts for an additional charge.</p>
<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028. This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. The walkie stacker has a subtype: the order picker forklift.</p>
<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these extraordinary machines or perhaps looking to diversify your fleet, here are seven different categories of forklifts and a summary of how they are used.

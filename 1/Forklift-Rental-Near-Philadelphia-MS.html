If you're an adventurous person or need a Chevy Silverado or any other truck with significant size and power, then you must test drive one of our lifted trucks.

A few strokes of the handle provide 110mm of lift, the PMHE-107 heavy duty pump is built to take thousands of pick-up and deposit cycles.</p>

<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>

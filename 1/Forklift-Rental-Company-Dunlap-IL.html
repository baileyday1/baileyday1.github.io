<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts.

Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward. There is a structure of movable parts which enable proper operating of the forklifts. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.

<p>We provide high quality counterbalance forklift, reach forklift truck, pallet truck, stacker dedicated to your business. The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine.

<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

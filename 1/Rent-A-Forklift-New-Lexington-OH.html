Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn.

The dual path is perfect for that driver who carries more weight on one side of their truck than the other. Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>

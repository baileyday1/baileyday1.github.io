Forklift rental and lease companies may have used forklifts for sale.

Even if you are just going to operate a forklift one time for a specific job, OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer.

Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>

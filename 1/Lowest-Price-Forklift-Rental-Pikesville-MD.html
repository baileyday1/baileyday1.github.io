The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>The majority of all rough terrain forklifts will have pneumatic tires since they are designed for traveling outdoors, such as on gravel or in yard work.

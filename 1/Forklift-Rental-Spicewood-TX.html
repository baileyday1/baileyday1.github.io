If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>

If the operator is riding in the order picking truck, they wear a specially designed safety harness to prevent falls.</p>
<p>3-wheel forklifts are typically more maneuverable than 4-wheel machines. Your crew can easily drive these machines through small openings and use them in tight workspaces. As a result, customers can get the best possible lift kit installation process.

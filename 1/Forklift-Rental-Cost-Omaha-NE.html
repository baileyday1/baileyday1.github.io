Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>With a body lift, clearances are increased for larger tires without the changes to suspension height or alignment angles. You'll also read about the most popular kinds of forklifts, helping you select the right rental for your needs. Choosing the right tires will impact on your forklift's handling and safety.

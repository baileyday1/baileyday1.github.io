This forklift line has four pneumatic tires, making it better for warehouse use.</p>
<h2>Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck Monticello </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>

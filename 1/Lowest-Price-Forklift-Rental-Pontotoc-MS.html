<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>At Frank Kent CDJR, we have used lifted trucks for sale, and our expert service staff can install lift kits into one of our new or used pickups for you. For instance, KION North America Corp., Summerville, S.C., released three new Linde electric pallet trucks delivering load capacities of 2,600-4,500 pounds. Buying diesel forklifts are the other option and are easy to refuel.</p>

<h3>Toyota Forklift Pontotoc MS</h3>
<p>While electric forklifts will require less maintenance, they will never be maintenance free. To achieve worker safety, Raymond developed the Raymond virtual reality (VR) simulator , a supplemental educational tool that helps new and experienced operators learn and practice forklift operating skills on an actual truck in a secure, warehouse environment. They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>Scissor lifts provide access for people or equipment to height-restricted areas (up to 90'). Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. The pallet trucks may be manual or battery-powered. We ensure that we are affordable and always reliable, so you can always count on having the best experience when you service, buy or hire a forklift with us.</p>

Avoid additional charges for any damages made or caused by the wrong use of the rental equipment under your care and custody. Do not tow or push railway cars or trucks with a forklift.</p>
<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>

A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>

<p>Simply pick up the mobile unit with any kind of forklift or truck and drive wherever you need to go. Top-notch customer service and trustworthy equipment—that's why Atlas is one of the leading Toyota forklift dealers in the Chicago, IL area.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>

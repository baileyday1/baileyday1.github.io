A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst.

If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.

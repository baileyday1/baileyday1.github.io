<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>

<p>The outstanding performance of the hydrostatic transmission with the permanent 4WD Compen® or connectable 4WD FullGrip® allows the easy carry of loads on the toughest grounds and narrow places. Every forklift is tailored to the required needs of your operation, providing the right solution for your warehouse operation. Designed to push through the toughest work days, these forklifts offer dependable performance and rugged durability in heavy-duty outdoor applications.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>

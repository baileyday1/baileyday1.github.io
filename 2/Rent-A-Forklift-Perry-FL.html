Rough terrain forklifts typically have rugged tyres and feature heavy-duty construction. For example, a hydraulic skate is not the same as a counterbalanced tricycle, although both are classified as forklifts.</p>

Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>As for the right amount of lift, a 2-, 4-, or 6-inch lift kit (or more) will give you more clearance for driving off-road.

Welcome to Dave Arbogast Lifted Trucks, located in Troy, Ohio. Three-wheeled counterbalance forklifts are mainly used in warehouses and loading docks where there isn't much room for maneuvering or turning.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>

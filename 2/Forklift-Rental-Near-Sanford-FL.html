<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona. This course covers how to safely and efficiently operate a rough terrain forklift, how to educate and evaluate other operators on their rough terrain forklift performance, identifying when and how to service and maintain forklifts and how to keep other workers around the forklift area safe.</p>

This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>

<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb.

Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

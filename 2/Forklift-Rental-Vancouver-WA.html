<p>This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used. The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment. Counterbalance forklift trucks, the most common type, its forks protrude from the front of the machine, with no outriggers or baselegs to support the load.</p>
<p>Our selection of rental equipment comes from leading brands that are trusted around the globe to deliver products that meet the highest quality standards. If you are looking to carry loads cross-country with a highly stable machine, then these forklifts are ideal. But the counterweight is larger and usually of a different design, to increase the lifting capacity.</p>

A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>

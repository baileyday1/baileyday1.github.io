H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years. MARCOM's Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks training has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>

<h2>Hydraulic Hand Pallet Trucks Nanuet </h2>
<p>Other organizations just don't want to buy new when they need this type of equipment only for temporary or seasonal tasks so they opt for a forklift rental.

IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>

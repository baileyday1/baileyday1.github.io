<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. We offer a range of financing options for companies who need a forklift now. In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

<p>State plans are OSHA-approved job safety and health programs operated by individual states instead of federal OSHA. One of the most popular adjustments to trucks is the lift kit - moving the entire truck higher in the air by changing out suspension parts. About 92% of these are forklifts, 1% are material handling equipment parts. This purchasing guide will examine the specific features that qualify the machines to be considered 'rough terrain'.</p>
<p>Order picking forklift truck means a forklift truck where the operator controls are incorporated with the lifting media and elevate with the lifting media. This heavy-duty multidirectional reach truck is AC driven with clear-view masts, 360° steering and sideways battery exchange for optimized productivity. For distributors who want to maximize their warehousing space through high density storage, a standup forklift offers significant advantages over a traditional sit-down truck.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>

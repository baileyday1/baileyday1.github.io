<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO.

The damage that can be done by this forklift can be to objects and people other than the operator.

<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

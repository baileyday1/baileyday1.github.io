<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts. Order Pickers : Use: Order picker trucks place the operator on an elevating platform along with the forks. 2It will probably be necessary to cover the surface of the tilting platform with a friction-increasing material such as liquid paint, adhesive applied tape containing friction material, or safety tread with perforated buttons.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
